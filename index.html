            <h3>WHO IS THIS MACKENZIE NOBLE GIRL?</h3>
            <p>My name is Mackenzie Noble, as we’ve discussed. But who am I? The easy answer would be: I am a college student that is trying to find out what I want out of life. I have two miniature dachshunds. I like hanging out with my friends and family for fun. But, there is a lot more to me than that.</p>

            <h3>WHO I AM.</h3>
            <p>I am someone who brings energy and positivity into every space I enter. I challenge myself to begin and end each day with a smile, grounding my mindset in gratitude and intention. One of my daily habits is making my bed each morning. This works as an intentional routine that ensures I start the day with accomplishment and discipline.</p>
            
            <p>At the core of who I am are three main values: faith, loyalty, and community.</p>
            <p><strong>Faith</strong> plays a central role in my life. I hold my Christian faith close to my heart, as it provides me with purpose, identity, and a strong moral foundation. It shapes the way I approach both my personal life and the way I interact with others.</p>
            <p><strong>Loyalty</strong> is a value I take seriously. I believe betrayal hurts bad. When I commit to something, it becomes a priority, and my word carries weight. If I say I will be there, I will be there. A lighthearted but fitting example of this is my dedication to Chicago sports. After 22 years as a fan, my loyalty has never wavered, and it never will. That same steadfast commitment defines how I approach relationships, teams, and responsibilities.</p>
            <p><strong>Community</strong> is a value I came to fully appreciate later in life. In high school, I was heavily involved. I was student body president, president of three other clubs, and leading the spirit squad for the student section. While I was well known, I felt disconnected. I was hesitant to be vulnerable and I was content with keeping a small circle, even if it meant feeling alone at times.</p>
            <p>That perspective shifted in college when I joined a sorority. Initially, I was unsure of how I would do in such a large community. Over time, it became one of the most transformative experiences of my life. I found a group of women who not only accepted me as I am, but consistently encouraged me to grow, lead, and believe in myself. Over the past four years, I have had the privilege of learning from those before me and leading those who came after me. My pledge class, in particular, redefined what community means to me. The personal growth I have experienced has been profound, and it has shown me the power of belonging and feeling truly worthy. “Worthy” is, in fact, my favorite word. It connects to every aspect of life. While I am no psychologist, I firmly believe emotional well-being influences every part of a person’s success and fulfillment, and knowing that even one person finds worth in you, changes everything.</p>
            
            <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 30px;">So, who am I? I hope this answered your question. If it doesn't, watch this video to meet me.</p>

            <div class="video-placeholder" style="margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 10px; background-color: #000;">
                <iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PLACEHOLDER" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <h3>SOME OTHER THINGS ABOUT ME</h3>
            <p>I value experiences over material possessions. I would much rather go to an event than buy a new pair of shoes, or travel to a new destination than purchase a luxury item. Meaningful moments and shared experiences are what stay with me.</p>
            <p>I also have a deep love for performing and public speaking. I enjoy singing and dancing, even if the music is often playing only in my head. Karaoke is one of my favorite things to do. Any day, any time, any place, I’m in. But that just goes to show how drawn I am to the spotlight– Or maybe it's the spotlight that is drawn to me. I am confident speaking to any audience and have emceed numerous events. I take pride in standing apart in a positive way. I am a risk-taker, driven by passion and determination, and willing to do what it takes to succeed.</p>
            <p>But most of all, I am silly. My favorite TV show is Spongebob. I have an older brother and he is the funniest person most people have ever met. I am only about half as funny as him. Growing up with him has made me who I am today. He is your run-of-the-mill older brother. Annoying, disorganized and always knows how to push my buttons. But besides all of that, he is my favorite person in the world. He is a fireman, so a local hero, but he has always been my hero. Someone who has not only supported me through it all, but been there to protect me. He will never admit it, but I know he is my number one fan. It has been a pleasure growing up with him. Having a sibling is the most interesting relationship to me. The person who shares DNA with you. At least being the youngest, I have never had to live a day without my brother being part of my life, and I hope I never have to. The person who you share a family with, the most complicated type of relationship. The person that no matter how hard you try they will always have a piece of you in some way. For me, my brother is my best friend. Being away from home for college, we don’t talk a lot, but he is still my favorite person, because he knows me better than anyone else in this world, and I don’t ever think that will change no matter what happens. His compassion, humor and values stand him apart from anyone I have met.</p>

                <p><strong>Ken Fischer, Assistant Professor of Practice, UNL</strong></p>
                <p>January 9, 2026<br>
                To: Search Committee<br>
                I am writing to you to recommend Mackenzie Noble. Now in her senior year, Ms. Noble is an employee and volunteer on Nebraska Nightly, the university’s student television newscast. I am one of her instructors and supervisors. She started on the news team during her freshman year. I appreciate her punctuality and quest for excellence.</p>
                <p>After just one semester, Mackenzie joined our student leadership team. Later, in the spring of 2024, she assumed the role of Executive Producer of the newscast. She led the Nebraska Nightly team by mentoring students, coordinating the day-to-day operation, and serving as the lead producer. The hard work of Ms. Noble and her team paid off. In April 2025, the Nebraska Nightly team won first place at the Broadcast Education Association Festival of Media Arts. The award was for the top student newscast in the nation.</p>
                <p>Mackenzie excels in both the classroom and the newsroom. She is a team player and can be both a follower and a leader. I have confidence in assigning her any work, large or small. In the spring of 2025, I added to her duties the position of teaching assistant in my upper-division television reporting course. The students benefited from her guidance. She remains calm and in control as she juggles several tasks against deadlines. Mackenzie is demanding of others, but most of all herself.</p>
                <p>Mackenzie is always learning; she continues to grow as a producer and anchor/reporter. Our student training operation would not function without the dedicated service of student staff like Mackenzie Noble. She was selected for a competitive internship with Gray Media in 2025. Ms. Noble is now ready to join the profession upon graduation in May 2026. She is a joy to work with and has the respect of her peers. I highly recommend her.</p>

                <p><strong>Cece Berger, Best Friend</strong></p>
                <p>When I think of Mackenzie Noble, the first word that comes to mind is radiant. She is always beaming with light– happy to be there, excited, and ready to get the show on the road. She truly shines in every room she walks into.</p>
                <p>The second word I would use is selfless. Mackenzie constantly puts others first, whether it’s baking banana bread with thoughtful notes for everyone or taking time out of her day to sit with our house mom and listen to her talk for an hour– she does everything for the benefit of others.</p>
                <p>Next is charisma. It’s hard to explain, but Mackenzie naturally draws people in with her personality and presence.</p>
                <p>She is also determined. Once she sets her mind to something, she gets it done, whether it’s building her Oscar Mayer project or striving to be one of the best candidates for any opportunity, she gives everything her full effort.</p>
                <p>Another word is reliable. I could call Mackenzie any day of the week and know she would be there for me without hesitation, no matter how far or inconvenient it might be.</p>
                <p>She is incredibly joyous, always laughing, smiling, and spreading positivity. Being around her is genuinely uplifting and contagious.</p>
                <p>Mackenzie is also unconditional in the way she loves her friends. Even when someone upsets her, she doesn’t hold grudges and continues to care deeply and fully.</p>
                <p>She is fierce, bold, confident, and powerful, especially on stage. While she is kind, she also stands up for herself and others with strength and passion.</p>
                <p>Another word that defines her is pure. Mackenzie has a genuinely sweet soul and an authentic heart that makes her truly special.</p>
                <p>Finally, she is addicting… in the best way. Everyone wants to be around her, everyone wants to know where she is, and it’s easy to see why she’s so loved by so many.</p>
                <p>These are the ten words I would use to describe Mackenzie Noble.</p>
